# File input and output (Mock-up ATM system)

A simple ATM-like program that stores user's basic information (Fullname, age, birthday, address) and a mock balance in their "ATM" account then saves it into a .txt file.

Features:
- login or register.
- The finished account is saved as a .txt file.
- If logged in, users can change their account values (Fullname, age, birthday, address, and balance).
- Users can log in even after runtime has ended as long as they log in using the username and password of their account.
- Users can print the values of their account.
- Users can delete their accounts (deletes the .txt file).
